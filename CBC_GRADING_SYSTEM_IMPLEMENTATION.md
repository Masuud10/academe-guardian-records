```typescript
// Example: Mathematics strands
const mathStrands = [
  "Number and Place Value",
  "Addition and Subtraction",
  "Multiplication and Division",
  "Fractions",
  "Geometry",
  "Measurement",
  "Statistics",
];
```

### 4. Integration with Existing System

The CBC system integrates seamlessly with the existing curriculum-based grading router:

```typescript
// In CurriculumBasedGradingRouter.tsx
case "cbc":
  return (
    <CBCGradingIntegration
      classId={selectedClass}
      subjectId={subjects[0]?.id || ""}
      term={selectedTerm}
      academicYear={new Date().getFullYear().toString()}
      students={students}
      isReadOnly={isReadOnly}
      isPrincipal={isPrincipal}
      onSave={handleSave}
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
    />
